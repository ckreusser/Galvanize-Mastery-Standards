# Describe Agile Principles

## Describe the 4 agile values

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

This value puts people first. It recognizes that collaboration and teamwork are a potential path to greatness. Conversely, over-valuing processes and tools is a path to the predictable.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

It's better to iterate and have an app evolve from its MVP state. Comprehensive documentation is only valid so long as the app remains unchanged. Moreover, a quality app's functionality should be immediately apparent to the user.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Contract negotiation is a bottleneck. It can limit the potential of an idea long before it has reached its apex. By having an open dialogue with a customer (through a designated team-member) it's much more likely that they will receive the product that they set out to create.

### Responding to change over following a plan

Following a plan can yield tremendous results. However, things so rarely go according to plan. Being capable of moving to an area of need will result in a better product in the long-run.



### Describe velocity

Velocity in agile is assigning difficulty values to user stories then using that data over an iteration to estimate time to completion.

### Describe the format and purpose of retrospectives

Retro's generally come in the form of Start's, Stop's, and Continue's. By reflecting on the successes and failures of a project it's likely that a team can increase its efficiency going forward.

### Pair programming

Pair programming is working directly with another developer. The 'driver' shares their screen with the 'navigator' and types/tests what the navigator specifies.

### Automated tests

Automated tests are created and used by agile developers to find and squash bugs as early as possible in the development process.

### Half-not-half-assed

It's better to have a fully-functional portion of a project than a 'completed' shitty project.
