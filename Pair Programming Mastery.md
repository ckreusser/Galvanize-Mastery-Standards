# Pair Programming Mastery

Exercise completed - Pixel Paint with Jake Robbins

 ### Did you drive or navigate or both?

Both. I spent the majority of the time driving but switched to navigation for a brief stint.

### What did you learn from pair programming?

I learned that I enjoy occupying the ‘coding shoes’ of another person while driving. It’s very interesting to approach problems from someone else’s perspective. Moreover, it’s inevitable that one will add to their knowledge base by typing and testing unfamiliar code. On the flip side I learned that navigating is quite tricky. Not only do you need to have a direction for the app but you have to be able to verbally communicate it with proper syntax. It’s a great way to live and breathe the technical terminology.

### Do you prefer pairing or working on your own?

I love pair programming. I would recommend it to anyone willing to listen.
