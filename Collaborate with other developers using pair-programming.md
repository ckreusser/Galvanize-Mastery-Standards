\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Pair Programming Mastery\
	Exercise completed - Pixel Paint with Jake Robbins\
\
\cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 Did you drive or navigate or both?\
	Both. I spent the majority of the time driving but switched to navigation for a brief stint.\

\cf2 \outl0\strokewidth0 What did you learn from pair programming?\
	I learned that I enjoy occupying the \'91coding shoes\'92 of another person while driving. It\'92s very interesting to approach problems from someone else\'92s perspective. Moreover, it\'92s inevitable that one will add to their knowledge base by typing and testing unfamiliar code. On the flip side I learned that navigating is quite tricky. Not only do you need to have a direction for the app but you have to be able to verbally communicate it with proper syntax. It\'92s a great way to live and breathe the technical terminology.\
